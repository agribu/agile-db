## A database policy enforcement proxy module for the AGILE IoT gateway

The database policy enforcement proxy extends the AGILE platform by generically implementing mechanisms to connect to SQL based databases, translate its structure into AGILE manageable entities and empower users to define access policies for
its usage by different authorised parties. This project is a proof-of-concept for the implementation of privacy requirements as part of my master thesis on "Data-Centric and Privacy-Preserving Security Requirements for Emergency IoT Systems", submitted to the University of Passau in January 2018.
